# Luc-Portfolio
This portfolio contains a collection of my data science and analytical projects ranging from web scraping to machine learning and quantitative finance.

# [Project 1: Can simple trend following trading strategies outperform the buy and hold strategy?](https://github.com/lucelsby/simple_trend_following.git)
* Created a set of trend-following strategies to identify buy/sell signals based on the performance of an asset using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
* Applied quant finance techniques to evaluate the performance of my trading strategies across both past market performance and risk.
* Employed data visualisation techniques to graphically display trading signals and help users follow the trading strategies.
* Tested the performance of my strategies across a range of securities from different asset classes and over different time periods and market cycles.
